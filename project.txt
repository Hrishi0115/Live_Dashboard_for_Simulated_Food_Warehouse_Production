Step 1: Define the Simulation Parameters
We will need to define the parameters of the simulation. This includes:
- Package Characteristics: Size, Shape, and the interval at which they pass the sensors
- Sensor Behaviour: Simulating how the sensor would react to each package based on its characterists

Step 2: Set up the Simulation Environment
We'll use Python for the simulation - we'll simulate the two types of sensors I selected:

- IR Sensor: Detects objects passing and breaks in an IR beam.
- Ultrasonic Sensor: Confirms object detection and helps calculate dimensions

Step 3: Simulate Sensor Data
We need to create functions that simulate the readings from the sensors based on the different package types.

Step 4: Implement Data Logging
This will involve simulating the data logging that would occur in the device, capturing information such as the count of the packages,
timestamps, and any other relevant data.

Step 5: Build Basic Processing Logic
After simulating the sensor data, we will need to process this data to maintain an accurate count and manage any discrepancies the sensors may pick up.

Step 6: Prepare for Dashboard Integration
- prepare the data in a format that can be easily used by a dashboard for real-time display
