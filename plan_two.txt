Step 1: Setup and Tools
- Tools: Python for simulation and backend,
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the dashboard, and WebSocket for real-time data communication

- Visual Simulation: Use a simple graphical library in Python, such as 'pygame' or 'turtle' to create a visual representation of the conveyor and packages.

Step 2: Simulating Enviroment with Visuals
- Enviromental Setup: Develop a visual conveyor belt environment where packages of different sizes and shapes move towards a sensor
- Sensor Interaction: Visualise the interaction between the package and IR sensor. Show how the sensor detects each package type differently, possible affecting the detection
logic.

Step 3: Data Processing and Logging
Sensor Data Handling: Develop the logic for how sensors detect and count packages based on their characteristics. This includes handling false detections or misses due to package
transparency or other factors.
Data Logging: Log every detection with timestamps, package type, and count.

Step 4: Real-Time Dashboard
Dashboard Setup: Use web technologies to create a dashboard that displays the count of packages, types of packages, and rates of flow.
Data Communication: Implement WebSocket to push updates from the simulation to the dashboard in real-time.

Step 5: Integrating and Testing
Integration: Ensure all components work seamlesslyâ€”visual simulation, sensor data processing, and dashboard updates.
Testing: Test the system thoroughly to ensure accuracy and responsiveness. Adjust detection algorithms based on package characteristics and conveyor speed.
